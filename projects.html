      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle">Falsetto</h2>
      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">2019</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent"> This game was developed under the designation that it had to revolve around sound. Falsetto was a clever play on words for the pitch of a voice which fit perfectly for our theme. Later on we decided it would be a super-bat which would be escaping a mad scientist&rsquo;s lab, blowing up and dodging obstacles along the way. We had less than 7 weeks to develop this game but were very proud of our result compared to the other groups involved as they struggled with source control such as merge errors and more. I worked on this during my time at Saint Lawrence college, and received a mark of 95% for my contributions to the project.</p>

<strong> Post mortem </strong><br />Communication was key, it was hard to find time outside of class to collaborate with everyone - therefore having strong communication is what helped us be the only team with a completely built / finished product
The game was made in 7 weeks, it was not a lot of time to implement the ideas we had created, as there was a lot of bugs that we ran into inbetween, we wished to have gone with a more flappy-bird-esque gameplay
Interesting finding out how time effects the game so much, based upon other scripts that are based off of time, we had to find work-arounds to make sure time was only being tracked while in-game

      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle"> Frogger Re-imagined</h2>
      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">2017</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent"> 
		The game Frogger Re-imagined was a final project for first semester students at Saint Lawrence college. This was one of my very first projects other than pong which was worked on solo. There were no groups allowed so everything you see below was programmed and created solely by me. The background images and sprites were sourced from free to use and share, modify commercially websites.

As development started for the game there were a lot of different concepts and design flaws that were scrapped such as the side view cars in a top-down perspective. The hardest feat was tweaking the flowing stream of water. There was a lot of code input defining the variables between the frog&rsquo;s states so that the game would feel natural. As I was fixing bugs along the way the shape of the game came together slowly and my sprites started to suit the look of the perspective.

The final design featured flies, top-down cars, a directionally flipping frog, and a moving stream! All these objects were instantiated via code in C++, debugged directly from visual studio. I also had wanted to make sure the game had a proper tracking system as you did not want the Frogger to die and respawn at the beginning capturing a fly, based upon his position he would be respawned by the water, on the other side or at the beginning of the road using a plethora of Booleans.

<strong>Post Mortem</strong><br />
	As this was a two week project there was not a lot of time for art assets, the art assets utilized were all free source and non-commercial, with more time I would have liked to bring my own aesthetic design to the game to compliment the gameplay
My idea was unique, but with testing seemed a little rigorous to complete, I would have wanted to continue developing the fun aspect of the gameplay&nbsp;
